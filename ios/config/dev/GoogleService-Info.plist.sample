<!-- Placeholder for GoogleService-Info.plist for the dev flavor. -->

<!--
You should replace this file with your actual GoogleService-Info.plist
file from the Firebase Console, specific to the 'dev' flavor.

Instructions:
1. Go to the Firebase Console and download the GoogleService-Info.plist file
   for your 'dev' app configuration.
2. Place the GoogleService-Info.plist file in this directory:
   ios/config/dev/GoogleService-Info.plist

To ensure the file is visible in Xcode:
- Open Xcode.
- In the project navigator, right-click on the `Runner/config/dev` folder.
- Choose 'Add Files to "Runner"' and select the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from `ios/config/dev/`.

Note: Xcode should automatically detect this file due to the run script in your build phases. 

You can safely delete this .sample file after adding the actual file.
